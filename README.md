# SENG 440 - Huffman Coding
## Execution Instructions

This project has three main programs contained within it. A Python3 script for generating test data, a Huffman encoder and Decoder.

To run the Python3 program run 
``` Python3 generator.py <fileLength>```. This will produce an outputfile.txt file with the specified number of characters in the file.
The other components of the program can be build using the ```Make``` command and run with ```./encoder``` and ```./decoder```.
